## Abstract

This study is a reproduction of unpublished research by Emmanual H Lyimo et al (2023), titled: Makuyuni Wildlife Corridor: Analysis of the Effects of Socioecological Interactions and Changing Land Use on Movement Patterns of Large Mammal Species. The original study evaluated the connectivity of Makuyuni Wildlife Corridor, a stretch of unprotected land between Tarangire National Park and Essmingor National Forest Reserve in Tanzania. We reproduce the first part of the study, a multifactor analysis model that approximates cost of movement through the corridor based on least cost pathway analysis. The study was originally conducted using the QGIS Model Builder, and we reproduce the workflow in R. The goal of the study is to reproduce the authors' map displaying the minimum cost of movement through each point in the study area, compare the reproduced map to the original map, and evaluate why the reproduction may differ from the original.

## Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

- `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
- `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
- `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
- `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.

The data, procedures, and results of this repository are outlined in three tables:
