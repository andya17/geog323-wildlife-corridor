Original least cost raster

- `Abstract`: This is one of the outputs of the QGIS model created by Justin Lucas. It is a least cost raster of the 
- `Spatial Coverage`: The data source pertains to the study site and a buffer zone surrounding the site.
- `Spatial Resolution`: 10 m
- `Spatial Reference System`: EPSG:3857 - WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator
- `Temporal Coverage`: 2023
- `Temporal Resolution`: Not applicable
- `Lineage`: This file is equivalent to the output of the QGIS model. The model included on the Google Drive as "finalmodel.model3". Running the model will produce a file named "DDclipped_cost". We assume that one instance of this file was named "DD_Cost_6" at some point before being uploaded to the Google Drive, since cost values are identical in both files.
- `Distribution`: This was shared by the original authors.
- `Constraints`: Unknown
- `Data Quality`: No planned quality assessment.
- `Variables`: The band shows the calculated least cost for an animal to travel across a given pixel.
